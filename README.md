### Summary
Transferability/Transportability has continuously been the central topic for transfer learning tasks, we design Automatic Transfer Learning (ATL) that embeds such information within the learning process automatically. We show that, under high-dimensional linear setting, ATL estimator is doubly robust for negative transfer given arbitrary sources and is computationally efficient. 

### Required packages
MASS, glmnet, ncvreg in R.
